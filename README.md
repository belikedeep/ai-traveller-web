# AI Traveller

AI Traveller is a full-stack travel planning web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React 19](https://react.dev/). It provides AI-powered itinerary generation, interactive trip mapping, payment integration, and user management, leveraging a modern TypeScript codebase and cloud APIs.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Key Modules

### Trip Generation (AI)

- Uses [Google Generative AI (Gemini)](https://ai.google.dev/) via [`service/AIModel.ts`](service/AIModel.ts:1) to generate detailed itineraries, hotel options, and daily plans.
- The AI model is configured for high-output, context-rich responses, and is used in trip creation flows.

### Place Search & Mapping

- Place details are fetched from the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) via [`app/api/place-details/route.ts`](app/api/place-details/route.ts:1).
- Interactive maps are rendered using the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) in [`components/trip/TripMap.tsx`](components/trip/TripMap.tsx:1), with geocoding, marker clustering, and info windows for each itinerary stop.

### Payments & Plans

- Payments are handled exclusively via [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/), not Stripe.
- The endpoint [`app/api/stripe/route.ts`](app/api/stripe/route.ts:1) creates Razorpay orders for plan upgrades, using plan metadata from [`lib/stripe`](lib/stripe-client.ts:1) and server-side Razorpay integration.
- User plans and credits are managed in Firestore.

### User Management & Credits

- User data (name, email, picture, credits, plan) is stored in [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) via [`service/UserService.ts`](service/UserService.ts:1) and [`service/FirebaseConfig.ts`](service/FirebaseConfig.ts:1).
- Credits are required for trip creation and are updated after successful payment.

### Local Info & UI

- Local guidelines, emergency info, and cultural tips are provided as part of the trip experience.
- The UI is built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/), and custom components for dialogs, toasts, and forms.

### Analytics & Auth

- [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) is used for analytics via a custom provider.
- Google OAuth is used for authentication and user onboarding.
